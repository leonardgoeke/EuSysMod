yellow,technology mapping,storage capacity,"in some cases input power capacities for stock technology 'gasStorage' are not defined, but other storage capacity exists, if not subject to other limits, these capacities are unrestricted"
yellow,technology mapping,storage capacity,"in some cases output power capacities for stock technology 'gasStorage' are not defined, but other storage capacity exists, if not subject to other limits, these capacities are unrestricted"
yellow,limit,expExc,"limits were provided without specificing the superordinate dispatch timestep, this means the sum over all years was limited instead of enforcing the same limit for each year (see https://leonardgoeke.github.io/AnyMOD.jl/stable/parameter_list/#Limits-on-quantities-dispatched)"
